# Exercise 1 : Call History
#
# Instructions
# Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. 
# When instantiating an object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.

class Phone:
    def __init__(self,phone_number):
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.call_history = []
        self.messages = []

# Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. 
# The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phone’s call_history.
    def call(self,other_phone):
        print(f'{self.phone_number} called {other_phone.phone_number}.')
        self.call_history.append(f'{self.phone_number} called {other_phone.phone_number}.')

# Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.
    def show_call_history(self):
        print(self.call_history)

# Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.
#
# Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. 
# Each message should be saved as a dictionary with the following keys:
# to : the number of another Phone object
# from : your phone number (also a Phone object)
# content

    def send_message(self,other_phone):
        print(f'{self.phone_number} send a message to {other_phone.phone_number}')
        self.messages.append({'to':{other_phone.phone_number}, 'from':{self.phone_number} })
#
# Create the following methods: show_outgoing_messages(self), show_incoming_messages(self), show_messages_from(self)

    def how_outgoing_messages(self):
        for dic in self.messages:
            if dic['from'] == self.phone_number:
                print(dic)
